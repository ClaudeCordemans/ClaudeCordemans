- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ClaudeCordemans. Several years ago (198x), I worked as a programmer in a SOHO and developped some accounting software and POS apps on a 
         french (!) based OS named Prologue (multi-users, multi-tasks) on PC's.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently unemployed and interested in computers and straw building (GREB) :-)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python. My motivation is to keep my programming knowledge alive and let it evolve to nowadays !
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ? python@cordemans.org
